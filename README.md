Note: this repo is a very busted WIP, mostly consisting of copy/paste from the
https://github.com/kasey/provider-terraform-gcp repo. The only interesting
content is in generated/resources, which is the output from using the 
aws
terraform running
github.com/crossplane-contrib/terraform-provider-gen 
against a provider plugin built from
https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws
@v3.9.0
